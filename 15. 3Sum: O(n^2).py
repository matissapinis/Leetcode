# 15. 3Sum
# https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/

# O(n^2) algorithm for unique triples that sum to 0 using sorting and two indices:
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Skip next equal adjacent number to avoid duplicates:
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and i > 0:
                continue

            # Initialize indices for going through remaining numbers after nums[i] from each side:

                    # If next numbers are duplicate skip further (up to right index):
